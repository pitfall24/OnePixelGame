###Inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM0ic5Ii-5w) video. No longer one pixel though.

Controls:
- Arrow keys for movement
- c to toggle cheat (removes bear)
- q or close window to exit
- i to increment score by 1
- o to increment score by 10
- p to multiply score by 2

Alternate between drinking water (not the salt water surrounding the island) and eating food to gain score.
Avoid the bear which moves every second or so to survive.

Only dependencies are [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.x (probably.)
